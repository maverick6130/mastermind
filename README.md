# mastermind
This repository contains implementation of a SAT encoding to solve the mastermind problem. The encoding focuses on minimizing the number of steps required to win the game. You can look up what mastermind is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)). As it turns out, the encoding we used was very similar to the paper available [here](https://nataliecollina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IWSpringPaper.pdf) and since ours was a bit sub-optimal, we've used this paper to improve performance further.
